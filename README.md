# ControllerCam
This project allows you to remotely control cameras using a regular game controller.
It is written in Go and should support a wide range of hard- and software.

## Support
### Controllers
See https://github.com/0xcafed00d/joystick

Tested with a rather new Xbox One controller over USB.

### Cameras
Most cameras supporting the VISCA protocol should work. Tested with a RGBLink PTZ (see [the reference](https://www.rgblink.com/uppic/file/202108230919504977.pdf)).

### OS
First-class Linux support. Should work on Windows and MacOS as well.

NOTE: currently, [the joystick library seems to be broken on Windows](https://github.com/0xcafed00d/joystick/issues/8)

## Getting help
